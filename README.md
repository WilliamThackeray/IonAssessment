# Ion Assessment
This is the Ion Assessment Repo. Below, we outline the steps you need to follow.

## Instructions
What we are looking for:

**Handling a REST API**: You can choose any API to work with.
**Handling an Array**: Take an array of data (from the API) and display it as a list.
**Handling Screen Change**: Allow the user to click on a list item to view detailed data on that item. Include a "Go Back" button.
**Git**: Please create a new branch named your_name-assessment.

## Tips:

Choose an API that allows fetching an array of data and provides additional data on each selected item within the array (e.g., SWAPI).
UI Consideration: While we donâ€™t require a complex design, we do value a clean and organized UI.

**API**: MoviesDatabase (https://rapidapi.com/SAdrian/api/moviesdatabase)

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
